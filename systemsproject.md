<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Heinz College Opioid Action Team—comprised of Masters candidates
from the Health Care, Public Policy, and Information Sciences Management
Programs—was tasked with applying advanced analytics to the fight
against the opioid epidemic in the Appalachian region. The team, in
partnership with SAS Institute: 1) built an interactive dashboard to explore
and analyze structured Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
claims data using SAS Viya, 2) augmented synthetic CMS claims data in
Python to create new tools and processes for CMS end users, and 3) pulled
via API call and processed unstructured public comment data from
regulations.gov removing duplicate comments and topic modeling. The
resulting three work flows enable end-users to utilize open-source and SAS
platforms to analyze, propose, and model solutions addressed at the opioid
epidemic in Appalachia.</p>
