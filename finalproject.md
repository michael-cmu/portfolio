## "Your Health Data Up for Grabs"

# Behind the Scenes 
## *Creating a StoryMap: 
# Part I: Idea
## Summary
Originally this idea started as a way to showcase how health information was being used. 
The first one-line summary was as follows:
>Healthcare information sharing is not currently meeting
>the needs of patients and their caregivers and 
>needs to improve or the quality of US healthcare will suffer.

Of course from viewing the StoryMap this idea changed based on feedback from user research as well as the data avaliable.
This change is reflected in the outline below. 

## Outline
### This was the original outline I used to create the first designs. 
* History and background of healthcare data and its sharing
* Resources that enable sharing
* Roadblocks to sharing this data
  * data to show these uptake issues
* Privacy and security concerns
* Potential solutions
  * companies that are helping
  * relevant use cases and statistics
* Regulations that support data sharing and patient privacy
* Call to action:
* Which legislation is promising and which standards are important

## Data: 
https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf 
After creating this outline I sought out data to help tell this story. 
What I found was data from the Office for Civil Rights as Part of the Department of Health and Human Services. This data found here https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf describes the disclosed health data breaches for the past year across the entire United States. This information enabled me to tell a comprehensive story related to health care data that the audience would be interested in learning about. 

### Data Characteristics: 
* 432 Rows
* Fields: 
Name of Covered Entity | State	Covered Entity | Type	Individuals Affected | Breach Submission Date	| Type of Breach | Location of Breached Information	| Business Associate Present | Web Description

## Method and Medium
To showcase this information in a visually engaging medium I chose to utilize ArcGis Story Maps to show geographic information as well as data visualizations from Raw.io. Images sources from the internet that enhance the story were also to be used. 

Story Maps is a great tool for this story as mentioned, geographic information is used and story maps allows for the creation of reactive web-based maps. Furthermore, this medium integrates with other formats such as svg files as well as traditional image and video files. 

### Method
This story seeks to convey these key points to the audience:

* The potential of Healthcare data 
* Risks from it's sharing
* Pitfalls from recent data breaches and oversharing.
* Current state of how patient info is shared
* What can be done?

First, the relevant data visualizations and key story elements were to be drafted on paper and shown to individuals at the Health Information Management Systems Society 2019 National Conference. This would allow for feedback from users that are in the target audience groups, individuals at risk of health data being breached and individuals in healthcare systems that have a stake in protecting information. 

The process to create this story is detailed further in the user research and design section below. 

# Part II: Design and User Research
### Drafting the story:
First step was to sketch and storyboard the critical elements of my story. Based on preliminary user feedback I am focusing on the impact of healthcare data breaches in the United States. 

Here are the first iterations of the story:

![Story_part2](https://michael-cmu.github.io/portfolio/story_2.jpg)

### User Research
* Target Audience: Healthcare executives with limited time and patient data activists 
  * Individuals were identified based on their interest in healthcare interoperability and experessed interested in data protection 
#### Script questions: 
> Can you explain to me what this story is telling you? 
> What questions come to mind when looking at this visualization? Can you explain this graphic to me? 
> What is the overall message of this story?

#### Sampled Feedback
I took these questions and sampled 4 individuals at the conference, 2 who were executives at regional health systems and 2 that worked in healthIT and were interested in data protection. I added their feedback along side the sketches as seen below:
![Story_feedback1](https://michael-cmu.github.io/portfolio/storyfeedback_1.jpg) 
![Story_feedback2](https://michael-cmu.github.io/portfolio/storyfeedback_1.jpg)

### Iterative Design
Armed with this information I sought out to redesign my story in a way that would appeal to the target audience. I wanted to convey the information I had found from https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf which details the years records of health data breaches that have been reported to the Office of Civil Rights within the US Department of Health and Human Services.

As the feedback from the original suggests led me towards a specific and precise message I crafted a new summary of this story. 
Under the title: "Your Health Data Up for Grabs", this was the summary of the project:
In the digital age, our personal health records are vunerable to being stolen, lost, or sold for malacious reasons. With millions of Americans being affected by these data breaches it is time something is done to protect our information. 

This was then translated into ArcGis StoryMaps. 

# Part III: Final Data Story
As part of the design process, I created these personas to model the desired audience for this story. 
#### Lisa Thompson: 
![Lisa](https://michael-cmu.github.io/portfolio/Lisa.PNG)
> The busy healthcare director in an organization that seeks to understand more about healthcare current events. 
#### Philip Daniel: 
![Philip](https://michael-cmu.github.io/portfolio/Philip.PNG)
> A hardworking machinist for the local manufacturing plant, who has had a series of health issues that have had him in and out of the hospital. 
Both of these individuals are interested in learning more about how health data breaches happen and affect them. For Lisa I created actionable policy items in the concluding parts of my StoryMaps to better detail what she can do at her healthcare organization to reduce the risk for health data breaches. For Philip (a concerned citizen) I created the first visual that immediately draws his attention as he has received medical care in Kentucky, which was affected by health data breaches last year.

## Design Decisions

When creating this StoryMap, I struggled between visual engagement and readability. The initial map for example; this map orginally displayed a symbolized map with concentric circles detailing the number of data breaches. This proved to be interesting to look at; however, was not easily understood by the target audience. 

As I continued to develop this project, I constantly sought out the advice of my peers in the healthcare program. While they are not quite the entire target audience of this piece, their insights proved critical for the end product that I have published here. Specifically, there feedback on sizing on text, clarity of visualizations, as well as the ordering of the story's sections were feedback that I had orginally not thought of. 

## Key Takeaways
* Telling Stories with Data is a iterative process that requires many inputs to generate a single output. 
* Great design is not static, it comes from continuous updating to suit the needs/wants of the desired audience
* Clear and concise visuals are better than flashy and obtuse visuals
* Always ask for help, I learned the most during this project from the feedback I received from others.
