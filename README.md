# About me
Hi! I am a 2nd year Health Care in Policy and Management Masters Candidate at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.
My background is in healthcare non-profits specifically focused on process improvement (TPS). I have transitioned through my Masters studies to focus more on healthcare innovation and entrepreneurship. 

I came to Heinz to learn skills. I have taken a Geographic Information Systems class, where I worked with a doctor to make Medicaid need areas around Baltimore. Furthermore, I have learned many software packages such as, R, Tableau, ArcGIS Pro, and Python. 

One day I hope to start and run my own company. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create stunning and powerful visualizations of data to help change other's lives for the better. More specifically, I want to design concise visuals for executive level stakeholders that convey complex information in a digestible manner.

Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
