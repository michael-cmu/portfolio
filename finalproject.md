# Here is how I created my StoryMaps, "Your Health Data Up for Grabs": 

https://arcg.is/19zfOq

# Part I: Idea
## Summary
Originally this idea started as a way to showcase how health information was being used. 
The first one-line summary was as follows:
>Healthcare information sharing is not currently meeting
>the needs of patients and their caregivers and 
>needs to improve or the quality of US healthcare will suffer.

Of course from viewing the StoryMap this idea changed based on feedback from user research as well as the data avaliable.
This change is reflected in the outline below. 

## Outline
### This was the original outline I used to create the first designs. 
* History and background of healthcare data and its sharing
* Resources that enable sharing
* Roadblocks to sharing this data
  * data to show these uptake issues
* Privacy and security concerns
* Potential solutions
  * companies that are helping
  * relevant use cases and statistics
* Regulations that support data sharing and patient privacy
* Call to action:
* Which legislation is promising and which standards are important

## Data: 
After creating this outline I sought out data to help tell this story. 
What I found was data from the Office for Civil Rights as Part of the Department of Health and Human Services. This data found here https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf describes the disclosed health data breaches for the past year across the entire United States. This information enabled me to tell a comprehensive story related to health care data that the audience would be interested in learning about. 

### Data Characteristics: 
* 432 Rows
* Fields: 
Name of Covered Entity | State	Covered Entity | Type	Individuals Affected | Breach Submission Date	| Type of Breach | Location of Breached Information	| Business Associate Present | Web Description

## Method and Medium
To showcase this information in a visually engaging medium I chose to utilize ArcGis Story Maps to show geographic information as well as data visualizations from Raw.io. Images sources from the internet that enhance the story were also to be used. 

Story Maps is a great tool for this story as mentioned, geographic information is used and story maps allows for the creation of reactive web-based maps. Furthermore, this medium integrates with other formats such as svg files as well as traditional image and video files. 



Key Points:
* The potential of Healthcare data 
* Risks from it's sharing
* Pitfalls from recent data breaches and oversharing.
* Current state of how patient info is shared
* What can be done?
